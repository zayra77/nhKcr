				<p><strong>nhKCR</strong> is a web server that could predict crotonylation sites from non-histone protein sequence. The proposed nhKCR is based on a novel method called <b>CNNrgb</b>,which based on an improved convolutional neural network called CNNrgb. It took AAindex, Binary and Blosum62 encoding scheme as three arrays of matrix of RGB.   
				It's AUC could achieve 0.882 and 0.878 for crotonylation sites through 5-fold cross-validation and independent test,respectively.
